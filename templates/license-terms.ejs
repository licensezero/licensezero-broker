## Background

I have made contributions to the project and granted a
public license for them.  My public license has rules
that either limit use for commercial purposes or require
release of source code for software built with my work.

This is a separate, private license for my contributions
to the project, with different rules.  Unlike my public
license, this private license lets you use my contributions
to the project for commercial purposes and build software
not released as open source.  However, this private license
applies only to you, and in a limited way to those you're
allowed to sublicense.

## No Liability

***As far as the law allows, my contributions to the
project come as is, without any warranty or condition,
and I will not be liable to anyone for any damages related
to the project or this license, under any kind of legal
claim.***

## Scope

This private license covers contributions I have made
to the project with the identifier in metadata, and any
contributions I make to the project in the future without
changing the identifier or adding a new one.  This private
license does not cover contributions I make to the project
in the future with a different or additional identifier.

## Copyright License

I license you to do everything with my contributions to the
project that would otherwise infringe my copyright in them.

## Notices

You must ensure that everyone who gets a copy of any of
my contributions to the project from you, with or without
changes, also gets the texts of the public licenses for
those contributions.

## Patent License

I license you to do everything with the project that
would otherwise infringe any patent claims I can license
or become able to license.

## Sublicensing

If you combine my contributions to the project with other
software in a larger application, you may sublicense
my contributions to the project as part of your larger
application, and allow further sublicensing in turn,
under these rules:

1. Your larger application must have significant
   additional content or functionality beyond that of
   the project, and end users must license your larger
   application primarily for that added content or
   functionality.

2. You may not sublicense anyone to break any rule of
   the public license for my contributions to the project
   for any changes of their own or any software besides
   your larger application.

3. No Liability, Defensive Termination, Sublicensing,
   and Redistribution must apply to each sublicense.

You may build, and sublicense for, as many larger
applications as you like.
